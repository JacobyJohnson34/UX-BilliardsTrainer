# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

It can be hard to learn a sport for the first time, especially billiards. Hence, users can now learn how to play billiards by playing drills and videos. Furthermore, they can track their stats by playing against real opponents and gain experience as they play. 

## Methods

### Competitive Analysis
One method of research we participated in is Competitive analysis. We gathered a small list of about four potential competitors. We determined this list by the hypothetical likelihood of what someone would search when curious about self-teaching billiards. The list consisted of Youtube, as it is a expansive resource that covers a multitude of topics with many different perspectives, DrillRoom, an app that is only available on IOS appstore and was one of the top results, Basic Billiards, a website which was amongst the top results and specializes in tutorials from beginner to advanced, and Physical Training Aids from OzoneBilliards, which was chosen because of the more hands on approach can be appealing. We categorized the competitors on their strengths and weaknesses, the quality of their content, the price of the user, and the availability of the platform.<br>

### Heuristic Evaluation
  Another method of research we used was Heuristic Evaluation. Using the data from our competitive analysis we determined that the biggest competitor is Billiards Trainer considering we are most closely related in terms of our project. We executed the heuristic evaluation across 10 categories, visibility of system status, Match between system and the real world, User Control and freedom, consistency and standards, error prevention, recognition rather than recall, flexibility & efficiency of use, Aesthetic and minimalist design, help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors, and help and documentation. These categories chosen were based off of the “10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design" by the Nielsen Norman Group. Each category was rated on a scale of 1-10, with 1 being non-existent and 10 being excellent. Notes were added to justify each rating given.


## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

<!-- MORE APPROPRIATE FOR THE FINDINGS SECTION YOU CAN EXPAND UPON THIS
  Youtube ranked rather high due to its variability in content and accessibility behind the product. However, this also brings the issue of little regulation on quality which could teach users incorrectly and its lack of skill assessment and skill tracking. It is a Free option and accessible on nearly all Internet-enabled devices.<br><br>
	DrillRoom, an IOS app is strong in its ability to train separate skills while being very active and leveraging the use of AI. Although, AI’s can be confidently wrong and the app follows a subscription model and requires a tripod and lighting to work. It should be noted that the expanded version was not tested due to our limited budget. For that reason Drill room, despite its rather high quality drills, is not as accessible or easy to use as other products.<br><br>
  Basic Billiards follows a free model with a website that is easy to jump into with selectable courses from the basics of how to hold a pool stick to the higher level strategy. While there is no interactivity, the articles are concise and most often have a video or animation to assist in making the point. The articles themselves are rather good quality, but there is no way to ensure the user has mastered the skill or is doing the drill correctly. It also is available on all internet-enabled devices.<br><br>
  The Physical training aid was not tested due to our limited budget. Regardless, we identified strengths and weaknesses to the best of our ability. The devices can be used without internet access and can help alleviate table specific issues. For Instance, bad bumpers, unlevel tables, chipped or dented balls. The downsides to the physical training aids is they are expensive with the cheaper ones going from 15$ upwards to 100$ per training aid, and you will need more than one in order to effectively train a vast skill set.<br>

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats
We did not take actual feedback from users so we made assumptions about who our users might and thus we could not do any testing.
<br/>
We are a novice UX team comprised of students, so the inability to dedicate a substantial amount of time and experience limits the teams ability.
<br>
We also have little to no funding, making it difficult to test products.
